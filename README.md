Pistachio Image Denoising using Autoencoder and U-Net
ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This project focuses on image denoising using deep learning to restore clean pistachio images corrupted by Gaussian noise (Î¼ = 0.0, Ïƒ = 0.1).
A Convolutional Autoencoder is used as the Baseline Model, while a U-Net Autoencoder is implemented as an enhanced model to achieve higher reconstruction quality.
Model performance is evaluated using the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM).

ðŸ§  Model Architecture

Baseline Model: Convolutional Autoencoder with a symmetric encoder-decoder structure.

U-Net Model: Skip-connected Autoencoder (U-Net) for better spatial feature preservation.

ðŸ“Š Model Performance Comparison
Model	SSIM (vs Clean Target)
Noisy Input	0.2787
Baseline Autoencoder	0.9536
U-Net Autoencoder	0.9755

âœ… The U-Net Autoencoder outperforms the baseline by achieving a higher SSIM score, effectively preserving texture and fine image details during reconstruction.
